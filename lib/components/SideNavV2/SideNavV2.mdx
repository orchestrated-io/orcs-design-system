# SideNav

This component is used for navigating the app and for providing extra options which are expanded and shown in the sidebar.

Expanded sidebar supports any content you'd like to put in them and the panel will scroll vertically if the content is taller than browser height.

Make sure you use an appropriate icon for each tab so that the intent of that tab section is conveyed as best as possible, e.g. filter icon for filters, cog icon for settings.

## New Sections

SideNavV2 now supports three additional sections above the main navigation:

- **Viewing**: Shows the current team, its type, and sub-navigation links.
- **Your Teams**: Shows a list of teams with avatars and links.
- **Pinned Items**: Shows a list of pinned items with avatars and links.

### Example Usage

```js run
const viewing = {
  teamName: "Nebula UI",
  teamLink: "/teams/nebula-ui",
  teamType: "Squad",
  teamAvatar: "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/lego/1.jpg",
  subNav: [
    { name: "Overview", link: "/teams/nebula-ui/overview", isActive: true },
    { name: "Org chart", link: "/teams/nebula-ui/org-chart" }
    // ...
  ]
};
