# Avatar

[Default avatar](#default-avatar) | [No image source](#no-image-source) | [Image only](#image-only) | [Icon only](#icon-only) | [Name as link](#name-as-link) | [Small size](#small-size) | [Large size](#large-size) | [Custom size](#custom-size) | [Custom subtitle content](#custom-subtitle-content) | [With local time](#with-local-time) | [Inverted style](#inverted-style) | [Alternate shapes](#alternate-shapes) | [Header Avatar Variant](#header-avatar-variant) | [Properties](#properties)

Avatars can come in a few different options. Firstly regular or small size.

Next, depending on what is available it can preferably contain an image file/source, if no image, then show initials as fall back, if no name/initials, then fall back to an icon.

Thirdly the title/name can be a link or just plain text.

Lastly you can specify whether it is being rendered on a dark background and the colours will change to suit this case.

Also, if no title/subtitle is specified then it will only show the circle avatar part.

When using an image and no title is set or the title is not a string then set the imageAlt attribute for accessiblity.

Follow example code below to achieve desired option.

## Default avatar

<Canvas of={stories.defaultAvatar} />

## No image source

In cases where an image is not available, fall back is to show initials.

<Canvas of={stories.noImage} />

## Image only

In cases title and subtitle are not provided, show image only.

<Canvas of={stories.imageOnly} />

## Icon only

In cases where neither an image or initials are available, fall back is to show icon.

<Canvas of={stories.iconOnly} />

## Name as link

This component can support a link for the name.

<Canvas of={stories.nameLink} />

<Canvas of={stories.small} />

## Large size

<Canvas of={stories.large} />

## Custom size

<Canvas of={stories.customSize} />

## Title Level

<Canvas of={stories.titleLevel} />

## Custom subtitle content

<Canvas of={stories.subtitleContent} />

## With local time

<Canvas of={stories.localTime} />

## Inverted

For when Avatar is used on a dark background.

<Canvas of={stories.inverted} />

## Alternate Shapes

Use a different shape when you would like to distinguish between an avatar for a person, and an avatar for another construct, like a team or tag.

<Canvas of={stories.alternateShapes} />

## Header Avatar Variant

This variant is designed for use in headers or profile sections where only the avatar is needed, with no title or subtitle. It supports custom sizing (small: 65px, large: 150px), shape, and an optional action button for editing or updating the avatar.

- Use `headerAvatar` prop to enable this mode.
- Use `onClick` to display the action button and pass onClick function to this button (only for large size).
- A white border and drop shadow are applied for visual emphasis.
