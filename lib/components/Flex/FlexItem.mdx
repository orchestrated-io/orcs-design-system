# FlexItem

[Properties](#properties) | [Examples](#examples) | [Upgrading](#upgrading)

To use `FlexItem` to control the spacing between children of `Flex` you must also import it:
`import { FlexItem } from "orca-design-system"`.

### Using `FlexItem`

You don't necessarily need to use `<FlexItem>` as the direct child element to `<Flex>` unless you need to apply specific `flexbox` properties to the item. In most cases, once you set the desired properties on `<Flex>` it will layout the child elements as intended, whether these be `<FlexItem>` or any other component like `<Box>` or even standard HTML like a `<div>` or `<span>`. However, if you want to use the flex-specific CSS properties for items within the container, like `flex` or `align-self`, you will need to use `FlexItem` to apply these properties.
