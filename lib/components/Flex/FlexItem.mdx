# FlexItem

[Properties](#properties) | [Examples](#examples) | [Upgrading](#upgrading)

To use `FlexItem` to control the spacing between children of `Flex` you must also import it:
`import { FlexItem } from "orca-design-system"`.

### Using `FlexItem`

You don't necessarily need to use `<FlexItem>` as the direct child element to `<Flex>` unless you need to apply specific `flexbox` properties to the item. In most cases, once you set the desired properties on `<Flex>` it will layout the child elements as intended, whether these be `<FlexItem>` or any other component like `<Box>` or even standard HTML like a `<div>` or `<span>`. However, if you want to use the flex-specific CSS properties for items within the container, like `flex` or `align-self`, you will need to use `FlexItem` to apply these properties.

  <Story id="components-flexitem--basic-flex-item" />
</Canvas>

## Upgrading

This component is a **breaking change** that replaces the [previous Flex component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-flex-component). Use the following table as a guide to convert from the old properties to new `Flex` properties. Refer to [systemtheme.js](https://github.com/orchestrated-io/orca-design-system/blob/master/packages/orcs-design-system/lib/systemtheme.js) for values.

### `FlexItem` properties

| **Old**    | **New**          |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `order`    | `order`          |
| `basis`    | `flexBasis`      |
| `grow`     | `flexGrow`       |
| `shrink`   | `flexShrink`     |
| `noShrink` | `flexShrink="0"` |
