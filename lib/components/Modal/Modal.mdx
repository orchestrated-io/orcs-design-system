# Modal

[Properties](#properties)

The `Modal` component brings up a popup container upon clicking on a `Button` that changes the `visible` property of the `Modal` to `true`.

This is a blank slate and functions to close the `Modal` and take any action must be specified (including any `Button` elements contained in the popup). The only element included by default is the close icon `X` on the upper right corner, which fires the `onClose` function when it is clicked.

You can set the height of a modal, and the content inside will scroll vertically if it exceeds the height of the modal.

For a dialogue pattern of this component that has Confirm and Cancel buttons, see [Dialogue](#basic-dialogue-modal) example below.

## Basic modal

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--basic-modal" />
</Canvas>

## Advanced modal

If required you can specify content for both a header and/or footer for the modal to get the following treatment, where the header and footer is fixed, and the body content scrollable.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--advanced-modal" />
</Canvas>

## Basic dialogue modal

This basic dialogue pattern should be used when Modal functions as a yes/no, ok/cancel style user interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--basic-dialogue-modal" />
</Canvas>

## Edit dialogue modal

This edit dialogue pattern should be used when Modal functions as a save/cancel, update/cancel style user interaction.

</Canvas>
