# Floating Panels

The Floating Panels Component is a flexible React component that can be used in two different ways.

1. Creates a set of collapsible panels floating on the screen. It's ideal for displaying information or controls that need to be easily accessible but not always visible.
2. Can be used as a control panel for actions, where instead of a set of collapsible panels, it's a single panel with a set of actions.

## Features

- Customisable container height
- Customisable position on the screen
- Expandable/collapsible panels
- Configurable icons and titles for each panel
- can default specific panels to start expanded on load
- Ability to include any content within panels (can pass content as a component)

## Usage

## Floating Panels as a set of collapsible panels

#### For floating togglable pop out panels. You can define the panels you want to display, like so:

```js run
const panels = [
  {
    id: "legend",
    iconName: "map",
    title: "Legend",
    expanded: true,
    content: <div>Legend content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "view-options",
    iconName: "eye",
    title: "View Options",
    content: <div>View options content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "person-details",
    iconName: "user",
    title: "Person Details",
    content: <div>Person details content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "properties",
    iconName: "gear",
    title: "Properties",
    content: <div>Properties content goes here</div>
  }
  // Add more panels as needed...
];
```

<Canvas of={stories.defaultFloatingPanels} />

## Floating Panels as a control panel

#### For a control panel, you can define the actions you want to display, like so:

<Canvas of={stories.floatingActionsPanel} />

## Properties
