# Floating Panels

The Floating Panels Component is a flexible React component that can be used in two different ways.

1. Creates a set of collapsible panels floating on the screen. It's ideal for displaying information or controls that need to be easily accessible but not always visible.
2. Can be used as a control panel for actions, where instead of a set of collapsible panels, it's a single panel with a set of actions.

## Features

- Customisable container height
- Customisable position on the screen
- Expandable/collapsible panels
- Configurable icons and titles for each panel
- Can chose panel to expand on initial load
- Ability to include any content within panels (can pass content as a component)

## Floating Panels with content

Panels that include `content` are inherently selectable and will display their content when selected.

## Floating Panels as a buttons

Panels without `content` are inherently unselectable. Include `onClick` to respond to clicks.

<Canvas of={stories.buttonFloatingPanels} />

## Aligning Floating Panels

You can align panels and their content to the left, right, or center of the parent container.

<Canvas of={stories.alignedFloatingPanels} />

## Lock panel selection

Include `disablePanelSelection={true}` to prevent selection changes. Useful while a panel is doing async work (such as performing an API query).

<Canvas of={stories.unselectableFloatingPanels} />

## Force panel highlight

Include `forceHighlight={true}` to make panels appear selected. Useful for mutually exclusive mode selection.

<small>Note: This should be replaced with a proper mode select solution.</small>
