# Floating Panels

The Floating Panels Component is a flexible React component that creates a set of collapsible panels floating on the screen. It's ideal for displaying information or controls that need to be easily accessible but not always visible.

## Features

- Customizable position on the screen
- Expandable/collapsible panels
- Configurable icons and titles for each panel
- Ability to include any content within panels

## Usage

```js run
const panels = [
  {
    id: "legend",
    iconName: "map",
    title: "Legend",
    defaultExpanded: true,
    children: <div>Legend content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "view-options",
    iconName: "eye",
    title: "View Options",
    defaultExpanded: true,
    children: <div>View options content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "person-details",
    iconName: "user",
    title: "Person Details",
    children: <div>Person details content goes here</div>
  },
  {
    id: "properties",
    iconName: "gear",
    title: "Properties",
    children: <div>Properties content goes here</div>
  }
  // Add more panels as needed...
];
```
