# Floating Panels

The Floating Panels Component is a flexible React component that can be used in two different ways.

1. Creates a set of collapsible panels floating on the screen. It's ideal for displaying information or controls that need to be easily accessible but not always visible.
2. Can be used as a control panel for actions, where instead of a set of collapsible panels, it's a single panel with a set of actions.

## Features

- Customisable container height
- Customisable position on the screen
- Expandable/collapsible panels
- Configurable icons and titles for each panel
- Can chose panel to expand on initial load
- Ability to include any content within panels (can pass content as a component)

## Floating Panels as a set of collapsible panels

Simply include `content` on panels to render the content of the panel.

Use `defaultExpandedPanelId` to pre-select a panel.

<Canvas of={stories.defaultFloatingPanels} />

## Floating Panels as a control panel

Exclude `content` to prevent selection, and include `onClick` to respond to clicks.

<Canvas of={stories.buttonFloatingPanels} />

## Temporarily disable panel selection

Simply include `disablePanelSelection={true}` to prevent selection changes.

Useful while a panel is doing async work (such as performing an API query).

<Canvas of={stories.unselectableFloatingPanels} />

## Properties

<Controls component={FloatingPanels} />
