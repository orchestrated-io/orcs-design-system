Notifications should be used to present important and contextual information to the user when particular events are triggered, e.g. saving, error etc. Make sure to use an appropriate icon and colour for the specific notification situation.

Default notifications are displayed inline, if a floating notification is required (if something happens that applies to the entire page/view/app for example) then you can add the floating prop, which you can see displayed in an example that is floating and stuck to the bottom right of this screen.

If you want your notification to be closable, you must use the onDismiss prop to correctly unmount the component. If you do not do this, clicking the close button will hide the notification visually using CSS and this will not be able to be shown again, even if the event that triggers the notification occurs again.

## Floating

This notification will appear on the bottom right corner of the browser's screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-notification--floating-notification" />
</Canvas>

## Floating and Centered

This floating notification will appear in the center bottom of the browser's screen. Note that this behaviour only works if the component also has the `floating` prop. A positioning prop along the vertical axis, eg `top` or `bottom`, will also need to be specified.
