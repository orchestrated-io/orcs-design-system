# Divider

[Default](#default) | [Dash](#dash) | [Inverted](#inverted) | [Span grid](#span-grid) | [Properties](#properties)

The Divider component should be used as a horizontal rule to break up content into meaningful sections.

As a general rule, the default divider with no props set should be used in most cases, however a thicker one can be used to emphasize a greater separation between content sections, and a light divider can be used to separate similar repeating items within a section, like a list of people/teams etc.

## Default

To be used throughout most of the app, in most cases purely the default Divider with no props should be used.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-divider--default-divider" />
</Canvas>

## Dash

To be used if you want a dashed divider

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-divider--dash-divider" />
</Canvas>

## Inverted

The inverted prop should be used if a divider is required on a dark background.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-divider--inverted-divider" />
</Canvas>

## Span grid

This prop is to be used when you need to use a divider between rows in a grid, this will allow the divider to span across all columns in the grid.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-divider--span-grid" />
</Canvas>

## Properties

<Controls component={Divider} />
