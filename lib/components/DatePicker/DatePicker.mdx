# DatePicker

[Single date](#single-date) | [Date range](#date-range) | [Properties](#properties)

DatePicker uses Airbnb's [react-dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates) under the hood. This is just a wrapper to override styles, the only props you need to specify is either single or range. For all functionality and additional required props refer to documentation here: https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates

## Single date

  <Story id="components-datepicker--single-date" />
</Canvas>

## Date range

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-datepicker--date-range" />
</Canvas>
