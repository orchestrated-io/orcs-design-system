# Actions Menu

[Default actions menu](#default-actions-menu) | [Left offset actions menu](#left-offset-actions-menu) | [Advanced actions menu](#advanced-actions-menu) | [Custom actions menu](#custom-actions-menu) | [Text button actions menu](#text-button-actions-menu) | [Properties](#properties)

This component should be used when an item in the UI has multiple actions that can be taken on it.

The child components `ActionsMenuItem` are rendered either as a react router link `<Link>`, standard html hyperlink `<a>`, or button `<button>`. Depending on what the function of the menu item needs to be, just use `to={/route}` + `as={Link}`, `href`, or `onClick={function}` and this component will render the correct element (see example code below).

## Default Actions Menu

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-actionsmenu--default-actions-menu" />
</Canvas>

## Left offset Actions Menu

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-actionsmenu--left-offset-actions-menu" />
</Canvas>

## Advanced Actions Menu

Advanced Actions Menu supports some further flexibility.

You can specify a `customTriggerComponent={}` so you can use any component you wish to trigger this, rather than the default three dots one.

You can control the closing behaviour of the menu by disabling default close using `closeOnClick={false}` and then setting your own function that calls `closeMenu` when you would like to close it.

This component is also flexible in that you can put whatever other content you would like in here, and write custom functionality for it (to see example of this, click 'Other' in example below).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-actionsmenu--advanced-actions-menu" />
</Canvas>

## Custom Actions Menu

If you would like to enhance the ActionsMenu without default behaviours, you can use `<ActionsMenuBody />` by passing in `toggleState` and `onToggle` props.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-actionsmenu--custom-actions-menu" />
</Canvas>

## Text Button Actions Menu

An example of using ActionsMenu paired with a text button trigger.

## Keep Actions Menu In View
