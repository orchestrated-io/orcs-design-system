# Header

Header component for app layout. Supports app name, username and avatar as props. And links as children.

When using links in the Header, use the `StyledLink` component to ensure mobile-responsiveness and consistency in the UI.

At screen sizes less than 1100px the links are instead moved into a mobile menu toggled by a burger icon button to play nice with smaller devices.
