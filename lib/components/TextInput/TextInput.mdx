The TextInput component can be used as default text inputs with separate label and input like top row examples; these should be used most of the time.

For extra flair, a floating prop can be added to display the label floating inside the input which animates on click; these should be used for stand out or important forms such as sign in/sign up, subscribe or contact us forms.

Examples also include three validation states: default, invalid, valid.

Ensure to use a unique id for each input, and helpful placeholder text which shows an example of what should be input is very useful to users.
