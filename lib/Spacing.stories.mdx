# Spacing

This design system uses several scales of values that define the space around and within components, as well as component sizes. These scales are contained in the design system's theme (default: `systemtheme`) and can be used as values for [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)-style props. Most components have wrappers that can access Styled System `space` and `layout` props.

The **space** scale is as follows. For ease of reference, we have added t-shirt sizing aliases, so `p="r"`, `p="4"`, and `p={4}` will all work.

Our default spacing is `r`, for "regular".

| **Array index ** | **T-shirt size** | **Value** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 0                | -                | 0         |
| 1                | xxs              | 2px       |
| 2                | xs               | 4px       |
| 3                | s                | 8px       |
| 4                | r                | 16px      |
| 5                | l                | 24px      |
| 6                | xl               | 32px      |
| 7                | xxl              | 64px      |
| 8                | xxxl             | 128px     |

The **sizes** scale works in a similar way.

For defining uniform space between elements, for example controlling the spacing between `Button` components within a `Flex` row, the `Spacer` component can be used. See the [Spacer component docs](./?path=/docs/components-spacer--margin) for examples and usage details.
