# Spacing

This design system uses a range of scales to define the space around and within components, as well as their sizes. These scales are part of the design system's theme (default: `systemtheme`) and can be utilized as values for [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)-style props. Most components come with wrappers that can access Styled System's `space` and `layout` props.

## Space Scale

The **space** scale defines the spacing values. For ease of reference, t-shirt sizing aliases have been added. For example, `p="r"`, `p="4"`, and `p={4}` are all valid and equivalent.

Our default spacing is `r`, which stands for "regular".

| **Array Index** | **T-shirt Size** | **Value** |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 0               | -                | 0         |
| 1               | xxs              | 2px       |
| 2               | xs               | 4px       |
| 3               | s                | 8px       |
| 4               | r                | 16px      |
| 5               | l                | 24px      |
| 6               | xl               | 32px      |
| 7               | xxl              | 64px      |
| 8               | xxxl             | 128px     |

## Sizes Scale

The **sizes** scale operates similarly to the space scale, providing consistent sizing values for components.

## Spacer Component

To define uniform space between elements, such as controlling the spacing between `Button` components within a `Flex` row, use the `Spacer` component. For more details and examples, refer to the [Spacer component documentation](./?path=/docs/components-spacer--margin).
