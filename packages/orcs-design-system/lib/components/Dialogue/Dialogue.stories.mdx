# Dialogue

[Properties](#properties)

This Dialogue component should be used for confirmation of certain actions. You can pass in a function on confirm, as shown by testAction, and the dialogue takes any of the button props and will pass them through to the button component, in this example we have used `colour="danger"` to make the button red.

You can add any child content as you wish, using other components, e.g.  But as a rough guide, try and keep this content minimal. This is not intended to be used to display large amounts of content like a modal.

Width is also configurable, units must be specified px, %, vw, etc...
