# Header

Header component for app layout. Supports app name, username and avatar as props. And links as children.

When using links in the Header, use the `StyledLink` component to ensure mobile-responsiveness and consistency in the UI.

At screen sizes less than 1100px the links are instead moved into a mobile menu toggled by a burger icon button to play nice with smaller devices.

## Default Header

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-header--default-header" />
</Preview>

## Alternative Header with search

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-header--header-with-search" />
</Preview>

## Properties

<Props of={Header} />
